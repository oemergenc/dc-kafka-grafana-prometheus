# Docker setup for simple monitoring stack
This repository contains a simple docker setup to quickly spin up a 
monitoring stack consisting of a grafana frontend and a prometheus backend.
This is useful if you want to debug the implementation of your metrics logic in
a mircoservice locally before rolling it out to a test or production environment.
